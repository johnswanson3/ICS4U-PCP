# Initial Project Statement

## Objective
Simple 2D side-scrolling platformer with various obstacles such as bots and terrain using unity and c#

## Motivations
Our motivation comes from the simplicity a platformer gives as well as the side scrolling possibility that gives a platform its unique appearance. We chose to create a platformer because it is one of the main genres of gaming which dwells on the curiosity we had in our childhood on the gameplay and now with our developing abilities with code, we can further our understanding of games and break the creation down to our understanding.  

## Languages
C# and Unity 

## Technology
We plan on using monodevelop or visual studio for coding in c#
to design the game we will use unity.

## Benefits
How will you benefit from this project?
We will learn to code in c# and further develop our passion for computer science and game programing. Hopefully, this project will open our minds to the various applications for computer science in our daily and professional lives. 

## Foreseeable Challenges
- Learning a new programming language 
- Artwork for the game
- Debugging the game
- Creating the basic foundation of its functionality
- Time management
